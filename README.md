A minimal and (soon to be) universal routing engine using [redux][redux],
[uniloc][uniloc], and the HTML5 history api. Inspired by
[@james_k_nelson][james-k-nelson]'s
[Simple Routing with Redux and React][redux-routing] and
[@agamennon][guilherme]'s [redux-tiny-router][redux-tiny-router].

It treats routing as simple state, stored in Redux and made available to
components via Redux's `connect()` wrapper. Manage your components however you
want using the route data generated by [uniloc][uniloc]. Use the included
`<Link/>` component to generate urls from route names and options (often
referred to as "reverse lookup"), and trigger routing events when users click
your links.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save unirouter redux
```

Redux is the only hard peer dependency, but if you want to use the `<Link/>`
component you'll need to install React as well:

```sh
# Optional
npm install --save react
```

## Initialize

Before you can use unirouter, you'll need to include the provided reducer in
your combined redux reducer:

```js
import {combineReducers, createStore} from 'redux'
import myReducer from '../path/to/my/reducer'
import unirouterReducer from 'unirouter/reducer'

const reducer = combineReducers({
  router: unirouterReducer,
  myStuff: myReducer,
})

let store = createStore(reducer)
```

You'll also need to call the `init()` function to set up your initial routing
information and establish event hooks for the HTML5 history api:

```js
import init from 'unirouter/init'
import getMyStore from '../path/to/my/store'

const store = getMyStore()

const routes = {
  listContacts: 'GET /contacts',
  postContact: 'POST /contacts',
  editContact: 'GET /contacts/:id',
}

const aliases = {
  'GET /': 'listContacts',
}

init(store, routes, aliases)
```

This is best done in your init script on the front end, or in your render
middleware on the server.

## Use

If the user were to come in with the url `/contacts/13/edit?details=true`, the
following state would be available using whatever key you passed to the
`combineReducers()` call mentioned above:

```js
{name: 'editContact', options: {id: 13, details: true}}
```

Use this in your top level component to determine which components should be
rendered based on the current route information.

To link directly to a route name, use the included `<Link/>` React component:

```js
export class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Edit Your Contacts</h1>
        <Link href="#edit-contacts" name="editContacts" options={{id: 13, details: true}}/>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
